## Inheritance

Inheritance is when the properties and methods of a base class are passed on to a derived class. The base class can also be referred to as the parent class, while the derived class can be referred to as the child class or subclass.

We use the keyword `extends` in this context. For example:

```
class Fish extends Animal
```

In this example, `Animal` is the base class, and `Fish` is the derived class.

### Types of Inheritance

There are different types of inheritance, including:

1. **Single Level Inheritance**
2. **Multi Level Inheritance**
3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
4. **Hybrid Inheritance**

Multiple inheritance is implemented using the concept of interfaces in Java.
